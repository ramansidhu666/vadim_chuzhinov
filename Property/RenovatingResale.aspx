                                        The money invested in improving your home will not always translate into an equivalent
            return in the selling price of your home. So careful planning is important if you
            want to increase the salability of your home and make a profit from your renovations.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Sometimes the least expensive improvements yields the highest paybacks. A lot of
            studies have shown that a fresh coat of paint on interior walls returns an average
            75 percent payback. So, a $2,000 paint job could increase a home’s selling price
            by $3500.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        To maximize salability, choose shades of white and tame versions of popular colours.
            Stay away from too many personal touches and custom work if you plan to re-sell.
            It is unlikely that your investment will be recouped and it may prevent the quick
            sale of your home.
                                    </p>

                                        The kitchen and bathroom are key areas to focus your renovation attentions. With
            average paybacks of 72 and 68 percent respectively, new fixtures, cabinets and tiles
            could be well worth the money and/or time and effort. The 1999 Renovations and Home
            Value Survey by the Appraisal Institute of Canada (AIC) highlighted the top renovations
            and the average rate of return:
