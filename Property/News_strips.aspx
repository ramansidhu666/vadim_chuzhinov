    <div class="top_text"><b>14 IMPORTANT FACTS TO CONSIDER BEFORE YOU TRY TO SELL YOUR OWN HOME </b></div>
    <div class="top_text">
        Occasionally, one can see "For Sale By Owner" signs, and some owners think that
        selling their own home will not only save them money, but believe they have an advantage
        over the sellers that have their home listed by a reputable Real Estate sales professional.
        Before you decide to take on this very important and legally complicated process…remember
        not even most Real Estate Lawyer's recommend selling your own home yourself in today's
        market. Here are a few of the reasons why:
    </div>
    <div class="top_text">
        1. You are limiting your exposure to potential buyers (less than 10% of what a good
        real estate broker will generate) which theoretically means your home will take
        ten to fifteen times longer to sell on the market.
    </div>
    <div class="top_text">
        2. The longer a home is on the market the lower the selling price is. Why? Because
        most buyers think that if the home has not sold after this long... there must be
        something wrong with the home.
    </div>
    <div class="top_text">
        3. The selling/buying process begins AFTER the buyer leaves your home. Most sellers
        think that all it takes is for someone to see their home, fall in love with the
        great decor... and the offer automatically will follow. Remember that the buying
        process begins after they leave your home. If a real estate sales representative
        does not represent the buyer, and they are looking on their own…they usually leave
        the home and start to talk themselves out of the buying process. Real estate professionals
        are trained on how to overcome buyers remorse--a very common occurrence.
    </div>
    <div class="top_text">
        4. Because of the limited exposure you will very likely end up with a lower selling
        price. Remember, in order to generate the highest price possible for your home…
        selling means exposure. You need the maximum exposure possible, to generate the
        highest price possible.
    </div>
    <div class="top_text">
        5. Most buyers find it extremely awkward to negotiate or even to talk directly with
        sellers and therefore avoid FSBO properties.
    </div>
    <div class="top_text">
        6. Lack of negotiating experience and lack of pertinent information often will result
        in a lower selling price, or worse yet, a bungled contract and possible lawsuits.
    </div>
    <div class="top_text">
        7. The majority of qualified buyers are working with experienced real estate professionals.
    </div>
    <div class="top_text">
        8. Many serious buyers will pass by a FSBO home merely because they recognize that
        it is not in the real estate mainstream, this can some times make them wary.
    </div>
    <div class="top_text">
        9. As most local buyers now retain an experienced real estate sales person to represent
        them as their buyer-agency, you will probably be negotiating against an experienced
        professional.
    </div>
    <div class="top_text">
        10. Expected savings in broker's fees will also be greatly reduced if you offer
        a selling commission to entice real estate sales representatives to bring potential
        buyers.
    </div>
    <div class="top_text">
        11. If you are planning to use a Lawyer to help you negotiate the offer, then your
        lawyer's fees will be considerably higher.
    </div>
    <div class="top_text">
        12. Only real estate sales representatives have access to the up-to-date market
        information. News reports cannot approach the timeliness or specificity available
        to real estate sales people. Further, real estate sales representatives are involved
        in home sales much more frequently than the average homeowner is. This familiarity
        leads to a degree of expertise that provides an edge on negotiating and successful
        selling.
    </div>
    <div class="top_text">
        13. You only pay the commission to the real estate broker, if they successfully
        sell your home at the price you are happy with.
    </div>
    <div class="top_text">
        14. Accepting an offer is one thing, ensuring a safe and successful closing is quite
        another. Real estate transactions usually always have problems on closing. At times,
        expecting the Buyers and Sellers Lawyer's to fight it out or resolve the problems,
        can sometimes mean the deal is lost. This is the time that your experienced real
        estate professional, can be the most important. Your Real Estate professional can
        act as a great mediator. Lawyers MUST act only on their client's instructions and
        are not paid to negotiate.
