            <h2>Mortgage Glossary</h2>
            <h2>Additional interest:</h2>
            <p>
                The amount sometimes charged by the bank when you prepay principal or renegotiate
                the terms of your mortgage. The amount compensates the bank for loss of revenue.
            </p>
            <h2>Amortization:</h2>
            <p>
                With a mortgage, the borrower agrees to pay back the amount borrowed over a period
                of time. This breaking of the loan into smaller parts to be paid back over uniform
                blocks of time is amortization.
            </p>
            <h2>Amortization period:</h2>
            <p>
                The actual number of years it will take to repay a mortgage in full. This period
                can be longer than the loan’s term. For example, a mortgage may have a five-year
                term and a 25-year amortization period.
            </p>
            <h2>Appraised value:</h2>
            <p>
                An estimate of the market value of the home and property that the borrower pledges
                as security for the mortgage. This value may be more or less than the purchase price
                of the property.
            </p>
            <h2>Assets:</h2>
            <p>
                The things of value that you own, such as your home, car or summer home.
                <h2>Below prime:</h2>
                <p>
                    A variable rate mortgage in which the interest rate varies with money market conditions.
                    At any given time, however, the rate will never exceed BMO Bank of Montreal’s prime
                    rate, less 0.375%.
                </p>
                <h2>Blended rate mortgage:</h2>
                <p>
                    A mortgage that combines the amount the borrower owes under an existing mortgage
                    with additional mortgage money required by the borrower. The interest rate for the
                    new amount borrowed is a "blend" – or combination – of the interest rate of the
                    old mortgage and the interest rate for the additional amount to be borrowed.
                </p>
                <h2>Blended mortgage payment:</h2>
                <p>
                    A regular instalment payment composed of both principal and interest in which part
                    of the money received is applied toward the principal of the loan and part is put
                    to pay the interest. This is the norm for mortgage payments.
                </p>
                <h2>Bridge financing:</h2>
                <p>
                    A loan made for a short term, to "bridge" (or cover) the time gap between completing
                    the purchase of one property and finalizing arrangements to pay for it. The need
                    for this type of financing often results from mismatched closing dates.
                </p>

                    privileges without additional interest.
