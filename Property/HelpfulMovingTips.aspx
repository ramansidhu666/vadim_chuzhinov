            <h2>Helpful Moving Tips</h2>
            <p>
                Book the movers. You can choose to have the movers pack everything, or just the
                breakables, or you can pack yourself. It’s a good idea to obtain estimates from
                several different companies.
            </p>
            <p>
                Give necessary written notice to your landlord and make arrangements for the return
                of any monies you have on deposit, if you rent your old home.Make arrangements for
                the gas and electric utilities, water softener, telephone and cable TV to be connected
                on the day the sale closes. Dispose safely of all flammable liquids as it is illegal
                for movers to carry them.
