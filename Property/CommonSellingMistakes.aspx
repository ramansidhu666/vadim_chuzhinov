                                        Every seller naturally wants to get the most money for his or her product. The most
            common mistake that causes sellers to get less than they hope for, however, is listing
            too high. Listings reach the greatest proportion of potential buyers shortly after
            they reach the market. If a property is dismissed as being overpriced early on,
            it can result in later price reductions. Overpriced properties tend to take an unusually
            long time to sell, and they end up being sold at a lower price than they likely
            would have had they been priced properly in the first place.

                                    <h2>Mistaking Re-finance Appraisals for Market Value</h2>
                                    <p>
                                        Re-finance appraisals can be very encouraging for homeowners, leading them to assume
            that the appraisal is the amount that they should expect to receive for their property.
            Lenders often estimate the value of your property higher than it actually is, however,
            in order to encourage re-financing. The market value of your home could actually
            be (and often is) lower. Your best bet is to ask your Realtor® for the most recent
            information regarding property sales in your community. This will give you an up-to-date
            and factually accurate estimate of your property value.
                                    </p>
                                    <h2>Failing to "Showcase"</h2>
                                    <p>
                                        In spite of how frequently this mistake is addressed and how simple it is to avoid,
            its prevalence is still widespread. When attempting to sell your home to prospective
            buyers, do not forget to make your home look as pleasant as possible. Make necessary
            repairs. Clean. Make sure everything functions and looks presentable, and remove
            as many possessions as you can prior to showing. A poorly kept home, or one with
            too much clutter, will make it dramatically more difficult for buyers to become
            emotionally interested in your property.

                                    <h2>Trying to "Hard Sell" While Showing</h2>
                                    <p>
                                        Buying a house is always an emotional and difficult decision. As a result, you should
            try to allow prospective buyers to comfortably examine your property. Don’t try
            haggling or forcefully selling. Instead, be friendly and hospitable. Pointing out
            any unnoticed amenities and being receptive to questions is advisable, but this
            is not the time for negotiation and salesmanship.
                                    </p>
                                    <h2>Trying to Sell to Lookers</h2>
                                    <p>
                                        A prospective buyer who shows interest because of a For Sale sign or an open house
            ad may not really be interested in your property. Often, buyers who are not accompanied
            by a Realtor® are 6-9 months away from buying, and are more interested in seeing
            what is out there than in actually making a purchase. They may still have to sell
            their house, or may not be able to afford a house yet. They may still even be unsure
            as to whether or not they want to relocate.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Your Realtor® should be able to distinguish realistic potential buyers from mere
            lookers. Realtors® should usually find out a prospective buyer’s savings, credit
            rating, and purchasing power in general. If your Realtor® fails to find out this
            pertinent information, you should do some investigating and questioning on your
            own. This will help you avoid wasting valuable time marketing to the wrong people.
            If you have to do this work yourself, consider finding a new Realtor®.

                                    <h2>Being Ignorant of Your Rights & Responsibilities</h2>
                                    <p>
                                        It is extremely important that you are well-informed of the details of your real
            estate contract. Real estate contracts are legally binding documents, and they can
            often be complex and confusing. Not being aware of the terms in your contract could
            cost you thousands for repairs and inspections. Know what you are responsible for
            before signing any contract. Can the property be sold "as is"? How will deed restrictions
            and local zoning laws affect your transaction? Not knowing the answers to these
            kinds of questions could end up costing you a considerable amount of money.
                                    </p>
                                    <h2>Signing a Contract with No Escape</h2>
                                    <p>
                                        Hopefully you will have taken the time to choose the best Realtor® for you. But
            sometimes, as we all know, circumstances change. Perhaps you misjudged your Realtor®,
            or perhaps the Realtor® has other priorities on his or her mind. In any case, you
            should have the right to fire your agent. Also, you should have the right to select
            another agent of your choosing. Many real estate companies will simply replace an
            agent with another one, without consulting you. Be sure to have control over your
            situation before signing a real estate contract.
                                    </p>
                                    <h2>Limited Marketing</h2>
                                    <p>
                                        There are two obvious marketing tools that nearly every seller uses: open houses
            and classified ads. Unfortunately, these two tools are rather ineffective. Less
            than 1% of homes are sold at open houses, and less than 3% are sold because of classified
            ads. In fact, Realtors® often use open houses solely to attract future prospects,
            not to sell that particular house. Does your Realtor® have a website? There are
            very few successful real estate professionals who don’t, and for good reason.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Your Realtor® should employ a wide variety of marketing techniques and should be
            committed to selling your property; he or she should be available for every phone
            call from a prospective buyer. Most calls are received, and open houses are scheduled,
            during business hours, so make sure that your Realtor® is working on selling your
            home during these hours (many Realtors® work part-time).
                                    </p>
                                    <h2>Choosing the Wrong Realtor®</h2>
                                    <p>
                                        Selling your home could be the most important financial transaction in your lifetime.
            As a result, it is extremely important that you select a Realtor® who is a good
            match for you. Experienced real estate agents often cost the same as brand new agents.
            Chances are that the experienced agent will be able to bring you a higher price
            in less time and with fewer hassles.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Take your time when selecting a real estate agent. Interview several; ask them key
            questions. If you want to make your selling experience the best it can be, it is
            crucial that you select the best agent for you.
                                    </p>
